<p>
    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal <b>Gujarat</b>, western India,
    Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to
    the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India,
    where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to
    South Africa in 1893, to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.
    He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years.
